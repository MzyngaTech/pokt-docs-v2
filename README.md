# Welcome to POKT Network

### TL;DR:

We're building the RPC Base Layer to underpin Web3 with access to Unstoppable Open Data.

---

### Why?

The project started in 2017, when ETH was in its first bull run.

At that time c.90% of relays were running through one centralized RPC service. Web3 needed a decentralized alternative. We started building DePIN long before DePIN got cool.

As of today, we have served over 650bn data requests for over 40 blockchains, using a global network of c.17k nodes distributed across 22 different countries.

### So what?

Infrastructure is one of the places where decentralization unlocks big performance benefits.
