You can the background of why Pocket decided to build
on top of a modular stack [here](https://www.pokt.network/blog/pokt-network-rolling-into-the-modular-future-of-the-protocol-a-technical-deep-dive).

Poktroll is an active WIP. The repository with the ongoing implementation can be
found in the [poktroll repository](https://github.com/pokt-network/poktroll/).

The technical documentation for the repository currently resides at [dev.poktroll.com](https://dev.poktroll.com).
