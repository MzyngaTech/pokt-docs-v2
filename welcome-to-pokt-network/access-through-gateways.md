# Access through Gateways

POKT Network is the RPC base layer, but Gateways are how you access it.

> _If blockchains are vast repositories of data, POKT Network builds and maintains the pipes and values that move that data around the ecosystem, and Gateways are the taps that make it easy for developers to use the data when building their apps._

This is how it broadly works today:

Today we have 2 Gateways: [Grove](../get-rpcs/find-a-gateway/grove.md) and [Nodies](../get-rpcs/find-a-gateway/nodies.md)
