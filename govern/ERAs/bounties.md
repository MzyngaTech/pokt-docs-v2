#### Bounties

Bounties are open to support Keystone projects, protocol development or other key tasks.
Pocket operates both Developer and Ecosystem bounties. Developer bounties are [github issues](https://dev.poktroll.com/).
Ecosystem bounties can cover the vast array of short term non-technical needs of the community.

Bounties are open at every ERA period.
They are attached to any or all of the [ERA](README.md) ambitions.

Bounties are coming soon...

PEPs,POPs and Bounties are both opened by PNF.

**Bounties are a part of the larger [GROW](../README.md) grants.**

Other include

[Sockets](sockets.md)

[POPs](pops.md)

They are all under the mechanisms of [ERAs](README.md)
