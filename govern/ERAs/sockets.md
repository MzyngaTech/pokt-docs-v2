#### Sockets

Sockets are small grants to experinment on different tools that enable the network achieve it's ambitions.
(Rapid, permissionless seed grants)

Sockets are small seed-style grants that support community contributors to rapidly spin up and experiment with contributions towards our ambitions.

A Socket request must include:

**Ambition & Metric**
Each Socket needs to state the ambition it works toward and the metric it plans to influence, along with a short simple description of the work.

**Type of Socket**
Sockets can be opened for a Trial or as an Experiment/Initiative.

**Commitment**
Each socket needs a stated commitment that the contributor will work in the open and self report monthly, including where their workings will be visible if not directly in the forum itself. 

In this way, the Socket is transparent and open to everyone to assess the impact of the socket and its viability to continue.

**Wallet Address**
Each Socket must provide a wallet address for Socket payments
