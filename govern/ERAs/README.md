### POCKET NETWORK ERA

This era takes us up to the launch of our V1 Protocol which is the next major milestone in our path to bringing the world **_unstoppable access to open data._**. 

Pocket has 5 major Ambitions (BHAGs). Keystone projects lay the groundwork for us to realise these ambitions. As part of our culture to ‚Äúdefault to open‚Äù you can find a project plan, budget and key materials for each of the Keystone projects below.

#### DAO Ambitions
During this Pre-V1 Era.
The following are the ambitions set by the DAO through PNF.

Each of the above ambitions has specific keystone projects that ensure we realise our ambitions.

ERA creates certainty and alignment between our priorities and resource allocation decisions through an ERA Budget and allocations.

***
#### ERA Budget
Pocket DAO takes 10% of the overall block rewards.
The ERA budget comes from the block rewards which 80% go
to fund the ERA keystone projects and the remaining 20% of the rewards go to the DAO treasury.
The Era budget is a one time major budgeting practice to ensure the DAO allocates sufficient funds to pursue its priorities.
This has 2 parts:
- A defined budget for our keystone, must have projects.
- A defined 80% of the DAO take reserved for community contributions to the ambitions via RFPs (POPs) and seed funding contributions and experiments (Sockets).

The Era Budget makes funds available to contributors through our contribution mechanisms highlighted below:
- [Bounties](bounties.md)
- [Sockets](pops.md)
- [Pocket Open Priorities](sockets.md)

A 2 month coordination cycle to allow us to review, learn, adapt and iterate. These should allow us to calibrate within an era. These are a performance mechanism and a logical point to adjust, with an emphasis on learning/adaptability and not re-litigating strategy
