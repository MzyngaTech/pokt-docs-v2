#### POPs (Pocket Open Priorities)


These are larger pieces of work to which contributors or builder teams can make a request for consideration (RFC). 

PNF and others within the network will scope work to be completed and then make it available as POP.
Contributors will submit their consideration and PNF will play the role of credibly neutral steward, allocating such projects and rewards in the direction of teams with the highest capability, chance of success as well as other important factors like price.
This will allow Pocket to become a more decentralised project, allow builders to have access to larger opportunities, and hopefully create an environment of transparency and fairness for anyone to contribute to taking us forward.

**Each POP will have:-**

**Pop Requirements** 
The outline and objective of each POP is clearly stated in the POP post.
The objective can be quite broad in nature but each POP should make it clear the objective of the POP,the requirements expected to meet this objective, and any relevant information that might be required from contributors responding to this type of RFP.

**A submission period** 
POPs will have a submission period that is outlined up front. For example, some POPs may seek submissions over a 2 week period, during which contributors can outline their capability in submissions for assessment. 
Alternatively, there will be other POPs which may be “evergreen” in that submissions will be accepted and reviewed continuously, such as with new [gateway submissions](https://forum.pokt.network/t/open-priority-gateway-demo/4874).

**A review**
PNF will operate the POP process as the credibly neutral steward. 
They will review submissions and report both decisions of the submission process and their reasoning. 
For clarity, this means that PNF will report on who has been selected to complete a POP and why they were chosen over competing submissions.

PNF will be the one to open POPs in the immediate term. 

Current open POPs can be found at the [forum](https://forum.pokt.network/c/build/pop/120)
