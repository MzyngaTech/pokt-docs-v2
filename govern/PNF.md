### POCKET NETWORK FOUNDATION
Pocket is a distributed network that relays data requests and responses to and from any blockchain system. Pocket verifies all relayed data and proportionally rewards the participating nodes with **_native cryptographic token(POKT)_**.

Pocket network foundation is an organization that facilitates the progressive decentralization of Pocket Network via the DAO and the coordination of independent entities. 
>PNF is the effective steward of the Pocket Network ecosystem..


#### Roles and Responsibilities

- **Nurture Pocket’s values:** assist stakeholders with continued refinement and reinforcement of Pocket’s values.
- **Advocate for Pocket’s stakeholders:** be available to listen to all Pocket stakeholders, track and amplify their issues, and provide them with a platform to be heard by others.
- **Empower Pocket’s contributors:** support the personal development of Pocket contributors and unblock them from creating value.
- **Facilitate Pocket’s governance:** help Pocket stakeholders make more informed decisions and build the mechanisms required to make Pocket a true hyperstructure.
- **Preserve Pocket’s public goods:** help the DAO to protect the integrity of Pocket’s open-source IP.
- **Connect Pocket’s community:** facilitate meaningful connections and reduce coordination costs between Pocket stakeholders.
- **Represent Pocket’s DAO:** carry out the DAO’s wishes through governance transactions, contracting with third parties, monitoring counterparty compliance with contracts, and enforcing accountability standards.
- **Accelerate Pocket’s ecosystem:** maintain a thesis for Pocket’s success, support strategic initiatives that further the thesis, and channel contributions towards opportunities.
- **Defend against Pocket’s attack vectors:** proactively identify and neutralize attack vectors, protect the DAO’s checks and balances, and eliminate central points of failure.

#### Operating philosophies

We also set out the following operating philosophies that we feel will uphold our mission and make us role models for the standards - and stewards for the culture - that we expect members of the ecosystem to adopt and maintain:
- **Gardening, not Gatekeeping:** We will focus on helping a rich and diverse Pocket ecosystem to bloom, not on growing the size of (or reliance on) the Foundation.
- **Availability, not Access:** We will engage with and listen to all stakeholders, not create an ecosystem governed by proximity and connections.
- **Empowering, not Entitling:** We will level the playing field for everyone to contribute, not grant exclusive rights to the few.
- **Clarifying, not Controlling:** We will eliminate asymmetries of context, so that stakeholders can understand, align, and participate consensually, not force them to trust us and fall in line.
- **Partnering, not Parenting:** We will work side-by-side with the community as peers, maintaining a feedback loop built on conversation rather than curation, being constructive about our disagreements, thoughtful about our communication, and authentic about our blind spots.
- **Continuity, not Conviction:** We will provide a stable presence by anchoring around our values and our mission, not by subscribing stubbornly to specific solutions, to create a directionally consistent opportunity space for innovation and evolution.


#### Goals and Roadmap

#### Protocol Team

PNF’s mission is to grow Pocket Network into a [Hyperstructure](https://jacob.energy/hyperstructures.html).

Transitioning protocol development into the custody of the Pocket Network Foundation (PNF), on behalf of the DAO, is a necessary step in the continued decentralization of Pocket’s ecosystem, ensuring that the protocol is credibly neutral and open to all capable contributors. 

The current protocol team include :-

**Daniel Olshansky (Protocol lead)**
