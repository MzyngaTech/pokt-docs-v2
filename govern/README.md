## Pocket DAO OS

Pocket network DAO operate in total harmony of all stake holders through ERAs,these are set periods of time that align the DAO to the ambitions set by citizens of the network through PNF,the steward of the DAO.

Every ERA period is funded by the DAO treasury to the tune of 80% of the 10% network rewards,with every ERA having it's own ambitions.
These ambitions align towards our north star which is Protocol Revenue.

Once Ambitions are set the projects that align to those ambitions are granted funding through the GROW(Grants,Rewards,Opportunities & Work) grants.

### ERAS

As it is an ambition of the dao to create a sovereign crypto network on all dimensions of supply, demand, governance and capital markets.
The DAO adopts a mechanism of operation that allows for continous innovation and feedback without affecting the core functionality of execution.

These mechanism are implemented through ERA cycles,the current ERA is Pre-V1.

Each ERA has ambitions and each ambitions have keystone projects these projects are funded through the GROW grant which is coordinated by PNF and guided by the DAO through voting.
