## Citizenship
The benefits of clearly defining what it means to be a citizen of your community, and how to become one, extend beyond better organisational decision-making. 

This type of thoughtful membership and onboarding sets the stage for a deeper sense of belonging, creating the potential for more empathy and the social accountability of upholding your commitments as a member. 

Only when people understand and are aligned with the mission and values of our organisation, and knowledgeable in the mechanics of how our DAO and governance operate in driving towards our future vision, should they be entitled to participate in that system.

This is an important step in designing a system that is owned and governed by itâ€™s users, and also happens to be an excellent way to onboard people into our community.

#### How it works 

POKT DAO enshrines Citizenship as a pre-cursor to any governance power.
To get a citizen credential you need to complete 2 quests :-

- [DAO Quest](DAO_Quest.md)

- [DNA Quest](DNA_Quest.md) 

Once you complete the quest you can vote in the citizen house which is the foundation voting house of the DAO.
The citizens house currently has 10% of the total DAO voting power
