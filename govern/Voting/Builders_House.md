## Builders House

Pocket exists to bring unstoppable, open data to the world.
Anyone creating impact is a Builder and our new governance system uses the term Builder in this way.

This house controls 45% of the voting power of the protocol,it is made up of the following :-
- Builders of the protocol.
- Builders innovating or experimenting us forward with Sockets.
- Builders passing proposals that direct funds or change parameters.

Each of these builders relies on the other, and like all great open source projects, each builder benefits from the builders before them. 

**_We stand on the shoulders of giants._**

##### Qualification requirements:

Different types of impact are recognised within a set of Builder credentials.
We currently have eight (8) credentials of different values to build a reputational impact score which translates to governance power in the DAO.
The 8 credentials are:-

**OG Governor** - A DAO Voter migrated from the previous system, with the maximum impact score possible in the previous system 10 Points (Migrated Voter from previous system)

A Voter can earn as many credentials as their reputation allows for. 
However, governance power is only awarded up to 10 Points (the equivalent of 1 full vote) and only one credential in each of the 8 categories above can contribute to voting power (that is, you cannot earn 10 points just from bounties (1x2) or Proposals (5x2) or Sockets (2x5) for example).

The other two houses that complete the voting mechanisms are :- 

[Stakers House](Stakers_House.md)

[Citizens House](Citizens_House.md)

All houses together form the voting base that move the protocol forward.
