## Citizen's House

Our ambition to create a permissionless, yet restricted, entry to participating in POKT DAO does create some nuanced considerations about risks and capture. 
We have thought on these deeply and wish to share our logic here so that it can be further tested.

Citizen house is a 1 person 1 vote system with exactly 10% of total voting power.
Whether there is 10 citizens, 1000 citizens, or 1M citizens (dare to dream) the total voting power will always equal 10%.
The Citizenâ€™s house therefore encourages broad representation of all the stakeholders and participants in Pocket, without ever giving this group alone the majority voting power in the DAO. 

The more highly permissioned houses like the Builder and Staker House will ensure that the majority of power in the DAO resides with engaged users who are driving impact and have the most at stake.
Citizenship, in the context of the broader system, is unlikely to be botted in a way that can impact the integrity of the citizens house. 

Citizenship voting power still relies on having a valid Gitcoin Passport as a proof of personhood, all citizens complete involved quests (across multiple platforms), and mygateway.xyz use anti-bot mechanisms like CAPTCHA within the quest architecture itself

The other two houses that complete the voting mechanisms are :- 

[Stakers House](Stakers_House.md)

[Builders House](Builders_House.md)

All houses together form the voting base that move the protocol forward.
