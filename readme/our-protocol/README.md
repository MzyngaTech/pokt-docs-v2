### Introducing [Morse](morse/)

Our live Protocol (Morse) was built on top of the Tendermint framework within the Cosmos ecosystem. However, it has since evolved and we have made significant modifications to the original Tendermint codebase to optimize our specific use case.

Since launch this protocol has served almost 700bn relays across 50+ chains, through a network of c.15k nodes in 22 countries.

### Introducing [Shannon](shannon/)

All of our experience is currently being built into a major protocol upgrade called Shannon, after Claude Shannon who was the father of information theory.&#x20;

Shannon will deploy to Celestia's Mocha Testnet in February 2024 and is targeted to launch on MainNet at the end of Q2 2024.
